# This version:

This is a modified version of the Unity3-Globe example. This includes additional mini-views for a more thorough data exploration and comparison among countries and is adapted to interact with a Samsung Gear Smartwatch. As described in this paper:

# Unity3D-Globe
Unity3D Implementation for Chrome Experiment [WebGL Globe](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/globe)

**Unity3D-Globe** is a complete project in which you can use to add your own data and create your globe.

# Change Data Source
The default `DataLoader` loads a `JSON` file from Resources folder, the loader expect `JSON` in the following format:
```javascript
{
  "AllData": [
    {
      "Year": "1990",
      "Data": latitude, longitude, magnitude, latitude, longitude, magnitude, ...]
    },
    {
      "Year": "2000",
      "Data": latitude, longitude, magnitude, latitude, longitude, magnitude, ...]
    }
  ]
}
```

You can change the structure of the `JSON` file or even the data source as required and implement your own `DataLoader`.

# Visualize Your Data

* To visualize your data you'll need to have a GameObject with `DataVisualizer` component attached to it
* `DataVisualizer` needs a reference to the following elements:

<img align="right" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/p4qxm4ur09x5hh3/DataVisualizer.png?dl=0">

1. PointMaterial: this is a material used for the points mesh, this material should be able to use the vertex color data to set the final color of the vertex, there is a material created for this purpose under the materials folder which use a custom shader written for this purpose
2. Colors: a gradient to be used to assign each data point a color according to its value
3. Earth: the earth object in the scene.
4. Point Prefab: a prefab to the point which will be placed for each data value 
* After loading the data wrap it in array of `SeriesData`, the `SeriesData` is just a class that has a name and `float` array, the `float` array represent the series data in the following order [latitude, longitude, magnitude, latitude, longitude, magnitude, ...]
* Call the `CreateMeshes` function from your `DataVisualizer` and send it the series array that you have just created
* To switch the shown series just call `ActivateSeries` function on visualizer and send it the index of the series that you need to show.
